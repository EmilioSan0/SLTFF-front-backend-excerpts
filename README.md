# South Lake Tahoe Firefighter Foundation â€“ Project Excerpts

This repository highlights my contributions to the South Lake Tahoe Firefighter Foundation website, a year-long senior project my team and I completed at Sacramento State. https://sltfirefoundation.org/ 

## Overview
Our team of 8 built a full-stack web application for the SLTFF to share its mission, upcoming events, and community impact.  
This repo includes the frontend and backend code I developed for the About Us and Our Work pages.

## My Work
- Built frontend pages using React (TypeScript) and CSS Modules for responsive design  
- Connected components to backend APIs for live content updates  
- Wrote backend logic to retrieve tables such as team members, fire stations, Honors and project data  
- Implemented functionality for admin-side edits to update dynamically on the client side  

## Tech Stack
React (TypeScript) â€¢ Node.js â€¢ AWS â€¢ MySQL â€¢ RESTful APIs â€¢ Git/GitHub
